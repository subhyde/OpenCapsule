# OpenCapsule

OpenCapsule is a fun project that turns your device into your own personal time capsule.

# The idea sprout 

My girlfriend and I had a great idea to make a secondary Snapchat account to send all of our pictures and memories throughout the year so that we could have a "time capsule" to open when the year had hit.

# What happened?

It turns out snapchat will delete snaps sent after around 30 days. So, all of the pictures and funny moments we sent disappeared forever. which was a huge bummer.

# What kind of features are you going to implement?

I am planning on having a photo and media storage system where:
<ul>You can add friends to your bucket to contribute to the capsule</ul>
<ul>A "no peak" policy which wont let you access any of the files until the timer runs out</ul>
<ul>Option to set how long until the capsule will be ready to open</ul>
<ul>An email or SMS will be sent with your decryption key which will allow you to view all of your digital capsule files</ul>

I was trying to go for a neon / futuristic theme but at the moment it just looks pretty scary
